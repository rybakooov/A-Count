# A-Count
Redesign of the corporate website of a b2b company that provides remote accounting, assistance in law and personnel matters, as well as solving problems in related areas.

## About the project
The old website of the company was created 7 years ago and needed to be reworked, as the principle of operation, the cost of services and their content have changed. Also, the UI was quite outdated, and the amount of text on each page was so large that the average user simply did not start reading it.
